          Iâ€™m a web developer living in Seattle. I lean toward frontend and love
          building React apps, but also enjoy diving into server-side logic.

          I am currently seeking opportunities to collaborate with and learn
          from more experienced developers while contributing to challenging and
          interesting projects. Please have a look at my work and reach out if
          you like what you see, have any constructive criticism, or just feel
          like saying hi.
