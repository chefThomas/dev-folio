          Iâ€™m a web developer living in Seattle. I lean toward frontend and love
          building React apps, but also enjoy diving into server-side logic.

          I'm currently seeking opportunities to collaborate and grow while
          contributing to challenging and interesting projects. Please have a

          like having a chat.
